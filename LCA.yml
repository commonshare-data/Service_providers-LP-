  title: "About Life Cycle Assessment"
  sections:
    - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), also known as life cycle analysis, is a systematic approach used to evaluate the environmental impact associated with all phases of a commercial product, process, or service's life cycle. For instance, when examining a manufactured product, the assessment encompasses everything from the extraction and processing of raw materials (known as the "cradle" stage), through manufacturing, distribution, usage, and eventually recycling or disposal of the product's constituent materials.
    - An LCA study entails a comprehensive inventory of the energy and materials involved in the entire supply chain and value chain of a product, process, or service. It calculates the corresponding emissions that impact the environment. In essence, LCA evaluates the cumulative potential environmental impacts, with the objective of documenting and enhancing the overall environmental profile of the product. It provides a holistic foundation for comparing carbon footprints accurately. Widely recognized procedures for conducting LCAs are outlined in ISO's environmental management standards, particularly ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. ISO 14040 establishes the "principles and framework" of the Standard, while ISO 14044 outlines the "requirements and guidelines." ISO 14040 primarily targets a managerial audience, whereas ISO 14044 is more oriented towards practitioners.
    - As defined in ISO 14040's introductory section, LCA examines the environmental aspects and potential impacts throughout a product's entire life cycle, from acquiring raw materials through production, use, and disposal. The main categories of environmental impacts considered encompass resource use, human health, and ecological consequences. LCA has faced criticism, both in terms of its methodology's consistency, difficulty, cost, protection of intellectual property, and the delineation of system boundaries. When LCA methodologies are not rigorously adhered to, results can be influenced by practitioners' perspectives or the economic and political interests of sponsoring entities, leading to different outcomes from different parties.
    - LCA is sometimes interchangeably referred to as life cycle analysis, and due to its holistic examination of a product's life cycle impacts from raw material extraction (cradle) to disposal (grave), it is also known as "cradle-to-grave analysis." According to the Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory, LCA is a technique to evaluate the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with a product, process, or service by compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases, assessing potential environmental impacts, and interpreting the results to inform decision-making.   
    - Therefore, LCA serves as a means to assess the environmental consequences throughout a product's life cycle, including raw material extraction, materials processing, manufacturing, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. The objective is to enable decision-makers to choose products or processes that minimize environmental impact by considering the entire product system, thus avoiding sub-optimization that might occur when evaluating only individual processes.
    - In essence, LCA aims to compare the full spectrum of environmental effects attributable to products and services by quantifying all material flows' inputs and outputs and assessing their impact on the environment. This information facilitates process improvement, supports policy formulation, and provides a reliable basis for informed decision-making. The "life cycle" in LCA implies that a comprehensive assessment entails evaluating raw material production, manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal, including all transportation steps necessitated by the product's existence.
    - Despite efforts to standardize LCA, results from different studies often yield contradictory outcomes. As such, LCA should not be seen as providing unique and objective results but rather as a family of methods attempting to quantify results from different perspectives. There are two primary types of LCA methods ":" Attributional LCA and Consequential LCA. Attributional LCA seeks to attribute the burdens associated with the production and use of a product or service over a defined temporal period, while Consequential LCA focuses on identifying the environmental consequences of decisions or proposed changes in a system and incorporates market and economic considerations. Another type, "social LCA," assesses potential social and socio-economic implications and impacts and is intended to evaluate a product or service's effects on various stakeholders.
    - Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) is a valuable tool for companies to identify and assess potential social impacts across a product or service's lifecycle on stakeholders such as workers, local communities, and consumers. SLCA follows guidelines from UNEP/SETAC and builds upon ISO 26000:2010 Guidelines for Social Responsibility and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines.
    - LCA's limitation in focusing solely on ecological aspects distinguishes it from methods like product line analysis (PLA), which consider economic and social factors. However, this limitation is intentional to avoid methodological complexity, although it recognizes the importance of considering these factors when making product decisions. ISO 14000 series standards, particularly ISO 14040 and 14044, provide widely accepted procedures for LCA. Greenhouse gas (GHG) product life cycle assessments can also adhere to specifications such as Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050 and the GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard.
    - "According to ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, LCA consists of four distinct phases, each informing the subsequent stages, and none of the phases is considered finalized until the entire study is completed. These phases are:"
    - "Goal and Scope: The LCA begins with a clear statement of the study's purpose, audience, intended application, and reasons for conducting it. The scope outlines qualitative and quantitative details, such as the product system, functional unit, reference flow, system boundary, assumptions and limitations, data quality requirements, and allocation procedure."
    - "Inventory Analysis: This phase involves collecting data on the inputs and outputs of material and energy flows throughout the product's life cycle."
    - "Impact Assessment: Impact categories, such as resource depletion or human health effects, are assessed based on the collected inventory data."
    - "Interpretation: The results are evaluated, and conclusions are drawn, often considering the potential for improvement and making recommendations for environmentally sound decisions."
    - "In summary, LCA is a comprehensive methodology used to evaluate the environmental impact of a product, process, or service across its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal or recycling. It aims to provide a holistic assessment of environmental effects and inform sustainable decision-making."
